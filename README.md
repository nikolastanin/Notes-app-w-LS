# Notes app w/ Local Storage
Follow up to a To Do app I made before. <br>
In this version I added saving to Local Storage so the notes that user created can be saved and displayed when the browser tab reload's or the browser is reopened :) 
<br>Test the app : https://nikolastanin.github.io/To-Do-w-LS/
